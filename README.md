# Coupon Remption Form for WooCoCommerce

WooCommerce's cart will not show the coupon redemption form if the cart is empty. Instead, you can use the `[fgc_form]` shortcode to display the coupon form on any page you'd like. This is handy for creating a giveaway redemption that doesn't require any purchase.
